PROJECT : IDENTIFICATION OF DISEASES IN TEA LEAVES

OVERVIEW

Tea is a popular beverage consumed around the world. However, tea plants are susceptible to a number of diseases that can significantly impact crop yields. Early detection of these diseases is crucial for implementing effective control measures and minimizing losses. Traditional methods of disease identification rely on visual inspection by trained experts, which can be time-consuming and subjective. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using image processing and machine learning techniques to automate the identification of diseases in tea leaves.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify diseases in tea leaves from images. The model will be trained on a dataset of labeled images of tea leaves with different diseases. Once trained, the model will be able to classify new images of tea leaves as either healthy or diseased.

DATASETS

The project will use two publicly available datasets of tea leaf images:

The Tea Leaf Dataset (TLD) contains 6,000 images of tea leaves with four different diseases: Tea Leaf Blight (TLB), Tea Leaf Rust (TLR), Tea Leaf Webbing (TLW), and Tea Leaf Skeletonizer (TLS). The Tea Leaf Disease Dataset (TLDD) contains 2,000 images of tea leaves with five different diseases: TLB, TLR, TLW, TLS, and Tea Leaf Green Scale (TLGS).

METHODOLOGY

The project will follow the following methodology:

Data preprocessing: The images in the datasets will be preprocessed to resize them, normalize the pixel values, and augment the dataset with additional images using techniques such as flipping, rotating, and cropping. Feature extraction: Features will be extracted from the preprocessed images using techniques such as color histograms, texture analysis, and deep learning. Model selection and training: Different machine learning models will be trained on the extracted features and evaluated based on their accuracy on a held-out test set. The best model will be selected for the final disease identification system. Evaluation: The performance of the selected model will be evaluated on a separate test set and compared to the performance of human experts.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES

The project is expected to produce the following outcomes:

A trained machine learning model that can accurately identify diseases in tea leaves from images. A user-friendly interface for the disease identification system. A comprehensive evaluation of the system's performance. Impact

The successful completion of this project will have a significant impact on the tea industry by providing a reliable and efficient method for early detection of diseases in tea plants. This will enable farmers to take timely measures to control diseases and minimize crop losses. Additionally, the system can be used to educate tea growers and stakeholders about tea leaf diseases and their management.
